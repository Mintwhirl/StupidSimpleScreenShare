- **Ephemeral rooms** - Automatically expire after 1 hour for privacy

- **Rate limiting** - Upstash-powered protection (50 rooms/hour, 60 chat msgs/min, 2000 API calls/hour)
- **325 comprehensive tests** - Unit and integration tests with 71.75% code coverage

## Architecture

```
[Host Browser]  <-- P2P WebRTC (encrypted SRTP) -->  [Viewer Browser]
       |                                                      |
       --- Signaling (HTTPS) --> [Vercel + Upstash] <--------
```

- **Frontend**: React 19 with Vite
- **Signaling**: Vercel Serverless Functions + Upstash Redis
- **Media**: Direct P2P between browsers (video never touches servers)
- **Deployment**: Vercel with automated CI/CD
