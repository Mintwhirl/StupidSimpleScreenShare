# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## ADR-001: Component Refactoring Strategy

**Status**: Implemented  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Context**: The main App.jsx component had grown to 513 lines, making it difficult to maintain and test.

**Decision**: Refactor App.jsx into smaller, focused components and custom hooks.

**Components Created**:

- `SynthwaveBackground.jsx` - Handles animated background rendering
- `HomeView.jsx` - Main home screen with room creation/joining
- `AppHeader.jsx` - Application header for non-home views
- `SidebarPanels.jsx` - Chat and diagnostics panels
- `LoadingState.jsx` - Loading state component
- `ErrorState.jsx` - Error state component

**Custom Hooks Created**:

- `RoomContext.jsx` - Centralized state management (replaced useAppState)
- `useAnalytics.js` - Centralizes analytics and monitoring calls
- `useRoomManagement.js` - Handles room creation and joining logic

**Benefits**:

- Improved maintainability and testability
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier to add new features
- Reduced cognitive load when working on specific functionality

**Trade-offs**:

- Slightly more files to manage
- Initial refactoring effort required

## ADR-002: ESLint Configuration Strategy

**Status**: Analyzed and Optimized  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Context**: Initial audit suggested 50+ disabled ESLint rules were problematic.

**Decision**: Keep current ESLint configuration with minor optimizations.

**Analysis Results**:

- Current configuration is well-structured and appropriate
- "Disabled rules" are primarily intentional overrides for specific file types
- Security rules are properly enabled
- React rules are correctly configured for React 17+

**Actions Taken**:

- Removed unused `prop-types` dependency
- Created comprehensive ESLint audit report
- Documented rule decisions and justifications

**Benefits**:

- Maintains code quality without being overly restrictive
- Allows flexibility for different file types (tests, API, React components)
- Security and best practices rules remain enforced

## ADR-003: Test Coverage Threshold Strategy

**Status**: Implemented  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Context**: Test coverage was set to 15%, which is too low to be meaningful.

**Decision**: Increase coverage thresholds to 50% across all metrics.

**Rationale**:

- 50% provides meaningful coverage without being overly restrictive
- Allows gradual improvement over time
- Focuses on critical paths (API endpoints, WebRTC logic)

**Implementation**:

```javascript
thresholds: {
  global: {
    branches: 50,
    functions: 50,
    lines: 50,
    statements: 50,
  },
}
```

## ADR-004: CI Pipeline Optimization

**Status**: Implemented  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Context**: CI pipeline had redundant dependency installations and sequential job execution.

**Decision**: Implement parallel job execution and remove redundancy.

**Changes Made**:

- Split linting into separate parallel job
- Run lint, test, and security checks in parallel
- Build job depends on all parallel jobs completing
- Removed redundant dependency installations

**Benefits**:

- Faster CI execution times
- Better resource utilization
- Clearer job separation and dependencies

## ADR-005: WebRTC Signaling Architecture

**Status**: Current Implementation  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Context**: Application uses HTTP polling for WebRTC signaling.

**Decision**: Maintain current HTTP polling approach for "stupid simple" philosophy.

**Current Architecture**:

- HTTP polling for signaling (simple but not scalable)
- Redis for temporary data storage
- RESTful API endpoints for WebRTC operations

**Trade-offs**:

- ‚úÖ Simple to implement and debug
- ‚úÖ Works reliably across different network conditions
- ‚úÖ No WebSocket connection management complexity
- ‚ùå Higher latency compared to WebSocket
- ‚ùå More server load due to polling
- ‚ùå Not suitable for high-concurrency scenarios

**Future Considerations**:

- WebSocket signaling for better performance
- Hybrid approach (polling with WebSocket fallback)
- Document current limitations and scalability constraints

## ADR-006: Dependency Management Strategy

**Status**: Implemented  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Context**: Need to keep dependencies up-to-date while maintaining stability.

**Decision**: Implement phased dependency updates with thorough testing.

**Update Strategy**:

1. **Immediate**: Update non-breaking packages (patch/minor versions)
2. **Planned**: Research and plan major version updates (ESLint 9.x)
3. **Testing**: Test thoroughly after each update
4. **Documentation**: Document breaking changes and migration steps

**Completed Updates**:

- ‚úÖ `@upstash/redis`: 1.35.4 ‚Üí 1.35.6
- ‚úÖ `vite`: 7.1.9 ‚Üí 7.1.10
- üîÑ `eslint`: 8.57.1 ‚Üí 9.37.0 (planned for future)

## ADR-007: Code Organization Strategy

**Status**: Implemented  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Context**: Need to maintain clean, organized codebase as project grows.

**Decision**: Implement consistent file and folder organization patterns.

**Structure**:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/          # Reusable UI components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/              # Custom React hooks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/              # Utility functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/             # Configuration files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ App.jsx            # Main application component
```

**Naming Conventions**:

- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `HomeView.jsx`)
- Hooks: camelCase with 'use' prefix (e.g., `useWebRTC.js`)
- Utilities: camelCase (e.g., `analytics.js`)
- Tests: Same name with `.test.js` suffix

**Benefits**:

- Predictable file locations
- Easy to find and maintain code
- Scalable structure for future growth
