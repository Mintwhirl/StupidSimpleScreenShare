## Architecture Improvements

### Component Architecture

```
App.jsx (111 lines)
â”œâ”€â”€ SynthwaveBackground.jsx
â”œâ”€â”€ HomeView.jsx
â”œâ”€â”€ AppHeader.jsx
â”œâ”€â”€ SidebarPanels.jsx
â”œâ”€â”€ LoadingState.jsx
â””â”€â”€ ErrorState.jsx
```

### Hook Architecture

```
Custom Hooks
â”œâ”€â”€ useAppState.js (State Management)
â”œâ”€â”€ useAnalytics.js (Analytics & Monitoring)
â””â”€â”€ useRoomManagement.js (Room Operations)
```

### CI Pipeline Architecture

```
Parallel Jobs
â”œâ”€â”€ lint (ESLint + Prettier)
â”œâ”€â”€ test (Unit Tests + Coverage)
â”œâ”€â”€ security (Audit + Vulnerabilities)
â””â”€â”€ build (Production Build)
```

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Maintainability
